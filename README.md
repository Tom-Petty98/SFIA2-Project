### Introduction
The focus of this project was to make a core dev ops pipeline and design an application with a microservice arcitecture. 

### Brief 
Create a functional website following best practices. The website had to be comprised of four microservices that functioned and could be deployed inderpendently and must persist some data into a database. It must be fully intergrated with a vcs (git), have clear documentation and follow agile principles. This includes a project tracking board identifing user stories, tasks and progression. 

### soloution 
I decided to create a website that would generate three random words. A setting word was randomly generated by service 2, a noun was generated by service 3 and service 4 returned the outputs of service 2 and 3, formated them and added a tempo. Users could then create a story given the random scenario and share the story. The app used Nginx to allow access from only port 80. The develpoment also features a jenkins pipeline which is activated by a webhook. It builds images and pushes them to docker hub and uses ansible to setup the correct enviroment on additional VM's for a swarm deployment aswell as adds workers. Finally jenkins deploys the services as a stack using docker compose and each container is replicated allowing a rolling deployment.
